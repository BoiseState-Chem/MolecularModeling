    "Let's assume we have a carbon nanotube or an aquaporin protein (aka a water-channel protein) filled with water molecules at arbitrary positions. The water molecules are all identical (same mass) and they all start with the same speed, randomly oriented either up or down the channel. Assume that water molecules move as free particles in one dimension and that they have completely elastic collisions with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Given that the channel length is 10 nm, and the speed of the molecules is 1 nm/ns, what is the maximum time that it takes for all the water molecules to get out of the channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will run a simulation with only two particles. To make the simulation results more clear, one of the particles will start at the origin, and the other particle will start in the middle of the channel and will have a speed twice as large as the first particle. Moreover, the simulation has reflecting hard walls, meaning that when a particle hits the ends of the channel it will bounce back. "

    "Before you run any simulation, answer the following question(s):\n",

    "1. Consider a simplified problem where you only have one of the two particles at a time. Can you predict and draw a sketch of the trajectory (x vs. t) for these systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the simulation, change the parameters, and run the simulation again as many times as needed to answer the following question(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The simulation has a few parameters that you can play with explicitly. Which of these parameters is/are connected to the underlying physics of the problem (physical parameters) and which of these is/are instead connected to the numerical simulation (numerical parameters)?  \n",
    "3. For the physical parameter(s), what experimental observable is connected to the parameters or, alternatively, how would you set their initial values? \n",
    "4. For the numerical parameter(s), how do they affect the accuracy of the results? In other words, does the simulation run correctly for all possible values of these parameters? What issues do you find?\n",
    "5. For the numerical parameter(s), how do they affect the computational cost of the simulation? \n",
    "6. How would you decide the best value of the numerical parameters, given the physical properties of the system?\n",
    "7. The simulation loop is hiding (at least) one more numerical parameter, which is not explicitly exposed to the user. Can you find it and explain what it is?\n",
    "8. The simulation loop is designed for 2 particles. How many operations (lines of code) apply to each particle? How many operations apply to each pair of particles? If you where to trivially extend the code to N particles, what would be the scaling of the code with N? "
