    "### Part 1: Convergence of Total Energy\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run any simulation, answer the following question(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For which phase of carbon do you expect to find a finite band gap (a energy gap between the highest occupied electronic states and the lowest unoccupied states)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Pick one phase of carbon and one flavor od density functional (PBE, LDA, or PBESol). Run the simulation, change the parameters, and run the simulation again as many times as needed to answer the following question(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explore the effect of the basis set size (ecutwfc) on the computed total energy of the system. \n",
    "3. Since in most situations we will be using a special type of PP, called ultrasoft (us or paw), we can get away with a smaller number of plane waves for the description of the orbitals. However, to describe the total electronic density (used by some of the functionals), we still need a larger number of plane waves. Thus, the code has a second energy parameters (ecutrho) that may affect the accuracy of the calculation. The general rule of thumb is to choose ecutrho to be 8-10 times larger than ecutwfc. \n",
    "4. How much do the two cutoffs affect your calculation time? \n",
    "5. The other parameter that may affect the accuracy and cost of the calculation is the threshold for the convergence of the self consistent cycle (SCF) of KS-DFT. This parameter (in QE called conv_thr) is size extensive (so for larger systems you can get away with larger values). \n",
    "6. For some systems, especially if metallic or with a small bandgap, SCF convergence may be helped by allowing the orbitals to be partially occupied, as if the system was at high temperature. This trick involves using a occupation of the band that is smeared (i.e. setting the 'occupations' keyword to 'smearing'). While for the systems in this notebook it may not have a big effect, check if adding the smearing improves the convergence of the calculation, i.e. by reducing the number of SCF steps. \n",
    "7. Since all the calculations rely on a small periodic cell, we should make sure that we repeat the calculations for different values of the Brillouin-zone wavevector. The resolution of the points in reciprocal space has a strong effect on the computed bands and total energy. Verify the convergence of the calculations with k-points sampling."

    "While the calculations above give you a reasonable starting point on the selection of the parameters, often there are still strong variations in the total energy of the system even for very tight values of the parameters. In reality, most of the applications of DFT only care about relative energies. For example, in a chemical reaction we often want to compare the energy of the products with the one of the reactants. For phase stability we often only care about relative energies of different phases. When looking at energy differences, it is often the case that error cancellation speed up the convergence of the results with the numerical parameters. In the following, we will explore the effect of changing the lattice spacing of the crystals on the total energy, so as to determine the equilibrium lattice constant and the corresponding bulk modulus. \n",
