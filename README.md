# Introduction to Molecular Modeling and Computational Chemistry

This project contains notebooks and the assignments on different aspects connected to atomistic and molecular simulations of matter, relevant to chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. The notebooks are meant to provide an overview of basic principles of quantum chemistry (Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory, correlated methods), statistical physics (Classical Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo), and condensed matter physics (periodic systems, band structure). The material explores the algorithms and parameters connected with the implementations of these methods. 

This material was initially developed for the CHEM-561 class at Boise State, in the Fall 2025 semester.
