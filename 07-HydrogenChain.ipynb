The notebook will adopt a semi-empirical approximation to describe the energy levels of a finite chain of atoms and will allow to extrapolate the results to the theoretical result for Bloch states.

    "$$ \\psi_{\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r}) = e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} u_{\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function $u_{\\vec{k}}(\\vec{r})$ is identical in each lattice unit. \n",

    "in terms of the lattice constant $a$ and an integer (positive or negative) number $i$. \n",

    "In order to simplify the quantum-mechanical treatement of the problem, and given the symmetry of the system, we will adopt a very semplified semi-empirical (a.k.a. Tight-Binding or TB) description, equivalent to the Huckel Hamiltonian. \n",

    "1) we will assume a minimal basis set composed by a single atomic orbital per lattice site\n",
    "2) we will consider the basis set to be orthonormal, with no overlap between orbitals in nearby sites\n",
    "3) we will only consider on-site terms (on site energy $\\epsilon$ in TB notation, $\\alpha$ for the Huckel model) and first nearest-neighbor terms (hopping term $-t$ in TB, $\\beta$ in the Huckel model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above approximations and Bloch theorem, we only have one way to combine individual atomic orbitals. With only one orbital $f(r)$ per cell and all the translational symmetry of the system, the problem has no variational flexibility and the electronic states need to be of the form\n",

However, we can also approach the problem by considering a finite system of N atoms in a loop. We can explicitly build the TB Hamiltonian for this finite system and solve for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For a system of 6 atoms this is equivalent to the Huckel model of benzene. As the number of atoms in the loop goes to infinity, we expect this problem to converge to the expression above."

These special states are associated with special points in the reciprocal lattice. For the case of a 1D lattice, the two main high-symmetry points are the center of the Brillouin zone (also konwn as gamma point or $\\Gamma$) and the edge of the Brillouin zone (X). How are the solutions of the 1D TB Hamiltonian at these points? \n",
    "5. What is the shape (dispersion) of the total energy of the system as a function of the Brillouin zone vector close to $\\Gamma$? Compare this with the result for a free electron and, using the following relation, compare the effective mass, $m^{*}$,of the TB electron at $\\Gamma$ with the one of the free electron:\n",
